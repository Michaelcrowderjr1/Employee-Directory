## Description

This application allows users view their entire employee directory at once so they have quick access to their information. Its React functionality lets the user view a list of employees, search for a specific employee, and sort the employees by either name, phone, email or DOB. When you search for an employee it will immediately give the user a result.

## Usage

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name. Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees will render. The user will be able to:

Sort the table by at least one category.
Filter the users by at least one property.
